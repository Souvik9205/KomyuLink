## Project Overview

The Community Project aims to deliver a modular backend with strong security and error handling, alongside a modern frontend featuring reusable UI components and effective state management. The backend utilizes Prisma ORM and PostgreSQL, while the frontend is built with React and focuses on maintainability and user experience.

---

## Tech Stack

**Backend:**

- Node.js
- Prisma ORM
- PostgreSQL
- Docker
- Sentry (error monitoring)

**Frontend:**

- React
- State management (Redux, Zustand, etc.)
- Custom UI components

---

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/community.git
   cd community
   ```

2. **Set up the database:**
   - Configure PostgreSQL (see `/database` package)
   - Use Docker containers for local development

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start development servers:**
   - Backend: `npm run dev` (see `/backend`)
   - Frontend: `npm start` (see `/frontend`)
